It takes the route as the first argument, it's parents as the second and returns a string or anything that [router-link's to prop](https://router.vuejs.org/api/#to) can handle.\n\n  When returning an object it might be necessary to also provide a custom is-exact function like in the example below.\n\n  ```\n  <template>\n    <ds-menu\n      :routes=\"routes\"\n      :url-parser=\"urlParser\"\n      :is-exact=\"isExact\"></ds-menu>\n  </template>\n\n  <script>\n    export default {\n      data() {\n        return {\n          routes: [\n            {\n              name: 'Introduction'\n            },\n            {\n              name: 'Navigation',\n              children: [\n                {\n                  name: 'DsMenu'\n                },\n                {\n                  name: 'DsBreadcrumb'\n                }\n              ]\n            },\n            {\n              name: 'Typography'\n            },\n            {\n              name: 'Layout'\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      },\n      methods: {\n        urlParser(route) {\n          return {\n            name: route.name\n          }\n        },\n        isExact(url) {\n          return url.name === 'Introduction'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  ## Custom name parser\n\n  You can customize the menu item's name by providing a name parser function.\n\n  ```\n  <template>\n    <ds-menu\n      :routes=\"routes\"\n      :name-parser=\"nameParser\"></ds-menu>\n  </template>\n\n  <script>\n    export default {\n      data() {\n        return {\n          routes: [\n            {\n              name: 'Introduction'\n            },\n            {\n              name: 'Typography'\n            },\n            {\n              name: 'Layout'\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      },\n      methods: {\n        nameParser(route) {\n          return `My ${route.name}`\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  ## Customize menu items\n\n  You can customize top level menu items using slots. The slot name is equal to the routes name.\n\n  If you want to keep the sub menu for this menu item, be sure to use the `ds-menu-item` component and pass down the `route` and `parents` prop.\n\n  ```\n  <template>\n    <ds-menu :routes=\"routes\">\n      <ds-menu-item\n        @click=\"handleClick\"\n        slot=\"Navigation\"\n        slot-scope=\"item\"\n        :route=\"item.route\"\n        :parents=\"item.parents\">\n        Custom {{ item.route.name }}\n      </ds-menu-item>\n    </ds-menu>\n  </template>\n\n  <script>\n    export default {\n      data() {\n        return {\n          routes: [\n            {\n              name: 'Introduction',\n              path: '/'\n            },\n            {\n              name: 'Navigation',\n              path: '/navigation',\n              children: [\n                {\n                  name: 'Menu',\n                  path: '/navigation/dsmenu'\n                },\n                {\n                  name: 'Breadcrumb',\n                  path: '/navigation/dsbreadcrumb'\n                }\n              ]\n            },\n            {\n              name: 'Typography',\n              path: '/typography'\n            },\n            {\n              name: 'Layout',\n              path: '/layout'\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      },\n      methods: {\n        handleClick(event, route) {\n          event.preventDefault()\n          alert(`you clicked on ${route.name}`)\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  </script>\n  ```\n</docs>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Menu.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Menu.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","export default function (Component) {\n      Component.options.__docs = \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Basic usage\\n\\nDisplay an array of route objects.\\n```\\n<template>\\n  <ds-flex gutter=\\\"base\\\">\\n    <ds-flex-item>\\n      <ds-menu :routes=\\\"routes\\\">\\n      </ds-menu>\\n    </ds-flex-item>\\n    <ds-flex-item>\\n      <ds-menu :routes=\\\"routes\\\" inverse>\\n      </ds-menu>\\n    </ds-flex-item>\\n  </ds-flex>\\n\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\n  export default {\\n    data() {\\n      return {\\n        routes: [\\n          {\\n            name: 'Introduction',\\n            path: '/'\\n          },\\n          {\\n            name: 'Navigation',\\n            path: '/navigation',\\n            children: [\\n              {\\n                name: 'Menu',\\n                path: '/navigation/dsmenu'\\n              },\\n              {\\n                name: 'Breadcrumb',\\n                path: '/navigation/dsbreadcrumb'\\n              }\\n            ]\\n          },\\n          {\\n            name: 'Typography',\\n            path: '/typography'\\n          },\\n          {\\n            name: 'Layout',\\n            path: '/layout'\\n          }\\n        ]\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\n## Custom url parser\\n\\nBy default the url is equal to a route's path.

<ds-flex-item><ds-placeholder>same</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n      <ds-flex-item><ds-placeholder>same</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n    </ds-flex>\n  ```\n\n  You can set widths as parts of the whole.\n  ```\n    <ds-flex>\n      <ds-flex-item><ds-placeholder>1</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n      <ds-flex-item width=\"2\"><ds-placeholder>2</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n      <ds-flex-item width=\"3\"><ds-placeholder>3</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n    </ds-flex>\n  ```\n\n  You can set widths as fix values.\n  ```\n    <ds-flex>\n      <ds-flex-item width=\"200px\"><ds-placeholder>200px</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n      <ds-flex-item><ds-placeholder>1</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n      <ds-flex-item width=\"30%\"><ds-placeholder>30%</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n    </ds-flex>\n  ```\n\n  You can set a default width for each item on the flex component.\n  ```\n    <ds-flex width=\"50%\">\n      <ds-flex-item><ds-placeholder>item</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n      <ds-flex-item><ds-placeholder>item</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n      <ds-flex-item

<ds-flex-item><ds-placeholder>item</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n    </ds-flex>\n  ```\n\n  ## Column Gutter\n\n  You can set a gutter for the items as on the flex component.\n  ```\n    <ds-flex gutter=\"small\">\n      <ds-flex-item><ds-placeholder>same</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n      <ds-flex-item><ds-placeholder>same</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n    </ds-flex>\n    <ds-flex

Responsive Breakpoints\n\n  Sometimes we need to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.\n  Therefore width, gutter and direction can be set as an object of breakpoints `base, xs, sm, md, lg, xl`\n  ```\n    <ds-flex\n      :gutter=\"{ base: 'xx-small', md: 'small' }\"\n      :direction=\"{ md: 'row-reverse' }\">\n      <ds-flex-item :width=\"{ base: '100%', sm: 1, md: 1 }\">\n        <ds-placeholder>1@md</ds-placeholder>\n      </ds-flex-item>\n      <ds-flex-item :width=\"{ base: '100%', sm: 1, md: 2 }\">\n        <ds-placeholder>2@md</ds-placeholder>\n      </ds-flex-item>\n    </ds-flex>\n  ```\n\n  ## Common Patterns\n\n  Fix sidebar flex\n  ```\n    <ds-flex>\n      <ds-flex-item :width=\"{ base: '60px', md: '200px' }\">\n        <ds-placeholder>sidebar</ds-placeholder>\n      </ds-flex-item>\n      <ds-flex-item>\n        <ds-placeholder>main content</ds-placeholder>\n      </ds-flex-item>\n    </ds-flex>\n  ```\n\n  Grid list of items\n  ```\n    <ds-flex\n      :gutter=\"{ base: 'x-small', md: 'small' }\"\n      :width=\"{ base: '100%', sm: '50%', lg: '33.333332%' }\">\n      <ds-flex-item>\n        <ds-placeholder>item</ds-placeholder>\n

}\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  ## Specify fields\n\n  You can specify which fields to display\n  ```\n    <template>\n      <ds-table :data=\"tableData\" :fields=\"tableFields\">\n      </ds-table>\n    </template>\n\n    <script>\n      export default {\n        data() {\n          return {\n            tableFields: ['name', 'type'],\n            tableData: [\n              {\n                name:

Customize header\n\n  You can customize the header by setting fields as an object.\n\n  The value can be a string representing the fields label or an object with options.\n  ```\n    <template>\n      <ds-table :data=\"tableData\" :fields=\"tableFields\">\n      </ds-table>\n    </template>\n\n    <script>\n      export default {\n        data() {\n          return {\n            tableFields: {\n
