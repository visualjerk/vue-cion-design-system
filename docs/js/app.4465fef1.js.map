common UI problems like layout, typography, displaying data or data input.\\n\\nWhen no component fits your case, either extend an existing one or create a new one.\\n\\n### Extending existing components\\n\\nWhen extending components, make sure not to break existing features. If you really need to, it might be better to create a new one and mark the existing component as `deprecated`\\n\\n### Creating new components\\n\\nKeep a few things in mind when creating a new component:\\n* Keep it simple\\n* Keep it extendable\\n* Use Design Tokens wherever needed\\n* Document it\\n\\n\\n\"","\n      module.exports = {\n        functional: true,\n        render(_h, _vm) {\n          const { _c, _v, data, children = [] } = _vm;\n\n          const {\n            class: classNames,\n            staticClass,\n            style,\n            staticStyle,\n            attrs = {},\n            ...rest\n          } = data;\n\n          return _c(\n            'svg',\n            {\n              class: [classNames,staticClass],\n              style: [style,staticStyle],\n              attrs: Object.assign({\"xmlns\":\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\",\"viewBox\":\"0 0 32 32\"}, attrs),\n              ...rest,\n            },\n            children.concat([_c('path',{attrs:{\"d\":\"M14 5h4c1.093 0 2 .907 2 2v1h6c1.645 0 3 1.355 3 3v15H3V11c0-1.645 1.355-3 3-3h6V7c0-1.093.907-2 2-2zm0 2v1h4V7h-4zm-8 3c-.565 0-1 .435-1 1v13h22V11c0-.565-.435-1-1-1H6zm9 3h2v3h3v2h-3v3h-2v-3h-3v-2h3v-3z\"}})])\n          )\n        }\n      }\n    ","\n      module.exports = {\n        functional: true,\n        render(_h, _vm) {\n          const { _c, _v, data, children = [] } = _vm;\n\n          const {\n            class: classNames,\n            staticClass,\n            style,\n            staticStyle,\n            attrs = {},\n            ...rest\n          } = data;\n\n          return _c(\n            'svg',\n            {\n              class: [classNames,staticClass],\n              style: [style,staticStyle],\n              attrs: Object.assign({\"xmlns\":\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\",\"viewBox\":\"0 0 32 32\"}, attrs),\n              ...rest,\n            },\n            children.concat([_c('path',{attrs:{\"d\":\"M24.656 3.031c1.108 0 2.222.41 3.063 1.25 1.681 1.681 1.681 4.444 0 6.125l-2.813 2.781 1 1-1.406 1.406-1-1-9.5 9.5c-1.064 1.064-1.845 1.684-2.531 2.063s-1.277.493-1.688.563-.636.113-1.063.344-1.04.696-2 1.656l-.719.688-.719-.688-2-2L2.592 26l.688-.719c.986-.986 1.475-1.621 1.719-2.063s.276-.66.344-1.063.196-1.011.563-1.688.96-1.429 2-2.469l9.5-9.5-1-1 1.406-1.406 1 1 2.781-2.813a4.313 4.313 0 013.063-1.25zm0 2A2.34 2.34 0 0023 5.719L20.219 8.5l3.281 3.281L26.281 9a2.297 2.297 0 000-3.281 2.273 2.273 0 00-1.625-.688zm-5.843 4.875l-9.5 9.5c-.96.96-1.426 1.605-1.656 2.031s-.274.621-.344 1.031-.184 1.033-.563 1.719c-.259.469-.859 1.1-1.406 1.719l.75.75c.601-.529 1.227-1.126 1.688-1.375.677-.366 1.254-.463 1.656-.531s.621-.1 1.063-.344 1.108-.733 2.094-1.719l9.5-9.5z\"}})])\n          )\n        }\n      }\n    ","module.exports = {\"displayName\":\"DsFlexItem\",\"description\":\"\",\"tags\":{\"version\":[{\"description\":\"1.0.0\",\"title\":\"version\"}],\"see\":[{\"description\":\"DsFlex\",\"title\":\"see\"}]},\"exportName\":\"default\",\"props\":[{\"name\":\"width\",\"description\":\"The item's width\",\"tags\":{\"default\":[{\"description\":\"1\",\"title\":\"default\"}]},\"type\":{\"name\":\"string|number|object\"},\"defaultValue\":{\"func\":true,\"value\":\"function() {\\n  return this.$parentFlex ?
