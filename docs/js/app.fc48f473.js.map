If no path is available the url is constructed from the route's parents names and the route's name.\n\n  You can provide a custom url parser function. It takes the route as the first argument, it's parents as the second and returns a string or anything that [router-link's to prop](https://router.vuejs.org/api/#to) can handle.\n\n  When returning an object it might be necessary to also provide a custom is-exact function like in the example below.\n\n  ```\n  <template>\n    <ds-menu\n      :routes=\"routes\"\n      :url-parser=\"urlParser\"\n      :is-exact=\"isExact\"></ds-menu>\n  </template>\n\n  <script>\n    export default {\n      data() {\n        return {\n          routes: [\n            {\n              name: 'Introduction'\n            },\n            {\n              name: 'Navigation',\n              children: [\n                {\n                  name: 'DsMenu'\n                },\n                {\n                  name: 'DsBreadcrumb'\n                }\n              ]\n            },\n            {\n              name: 'Typography'\n            },\n            {\n              name: 'Layout'\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      },\n      methods: {\n        urlParser(route) {\n          return {\n            name: route.name\n          }\n        },\n        isExact(url) {\n          return url.name === 'Introduction'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  ## Custom name parser\n\n  You can customize the menu item's name by providing a name parser function.\n\n  ```\n  <template>\n    <ds-menu\n      :routes=\"routes\"\n      :name-parser=\"nameParser\"></ds-menu>\n  </template>\n\n  <script>\n    export default {\n      data() {\n        return {\n          routes: [\n            {\n              name: 'Introduction'\n            },\n            {\n              name: 'Typography'\n            },\n            {\n              name: 'Layout'\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      },\n      methods: {\n        nameParser(route) {\n          return `My ${route.name}`\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  ## Customize menu items\n\n  You can customize top level menu items using slots. The slot name is equal to the routes name.\n\n  If you want to keep the sub menu for this menu item, be sure to use the `ds-menu-item` component and pass down the `route` and `parents` prop.\n\n  ```\n  <template>\n    <ds-menu :routes=\"routes\">\n      <ds-menu-item\n        @click=\"handleClick\"\n        slot=\"Navigation\"\n        slot-scope=\"item\"\n        :route=\"item.route\"\n        :parents=\"item.parents\">\n        Custom {{ item.route.name }}\n      </ds-menu-item>\n    </ds-menu>\n  </template>\n\n  <script>\n    export default {\n      data() {\n        return {\n          routes: [\n            {\n              name: 'Introduction',\n              path: '/'\n            },\n            {\n              name: 'Navigation',\n              path: '/navigation',\n              children: [\n                {\n                  name: 'Menu',\n                  path: '/navigation/dsmenu'\n                },\n                {\n                  name: 'Breadcrumb',\n                  path: '/navigation/dsbreadcrumb'\n                }\n              ]\n            },\n            {\n              name: 'Typography',\n              path: '/typography'\n            },\n            {\n              name: 'Layout',\n              path: '/layout'\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      },\n      methods: {\n        handleClick(event, route) {\n          event.preventDefault()\n          alert(`you clicked on ${route.name}`)\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  </script>\n  ```\n</docs>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Menu.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Menu.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","export default function (Component) {\n      Component.options.__docs = \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Basic usage\\n\\nDisplay an array of route objects.\\n```\\n<template>\\n  <ds-flex gutter=\\\"base\\\">\\n    <ds-flex-item>\\n      <ds-menu :routes=\\\"routes\\\">\\n      </ds-menu>\\n    </ds-flex-item>\\n    <ds-flex-item>\\n      <ds-menu :routes=\\\"routes\\\" inverse>\\n      </ds-menu>\\n    </ds-flex-item>\\n  </ds-flex>\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\n  export default {\\n    data() {\\n      return {\\n        routes: [\\n          {\\n            name: 'Introduction',\\n            path: '/'\\n          },\\n          {\\n            name: 'Navigation',\\n            path: '/navigation',\\n            children: [\\n              {\\n                name: 'Menu',\\n                path: '/navigation/dsmenu'\\n              },\\n              {\\n                name: 'Breadcrumb',\\n                path: '/navigation/dsbreadcrumb'\\n              }\\n            ]\\n          },\\n          {\\n            name: 'Typography',\\n            path: '/typography'\\n          },\\n          {\\n            name: 'Layout',\\n            path: '/layout'\\n          }\\n        ]\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\n## Navbar\\n\\nDisplay the menu as a navbar.

<ds-flex-item><ds-placeholder>same</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n      <ds-flex-item><ds-placeholder>same</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n    </ds-flex>\n  ```\n\n  You can set widths as parts of the whole.\n  ```\n    <ds-flex>\n      <ds-flex-item><ds-placeholder>1</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n      <ds-flex-item width=\"2\"><ds-placeholder>2</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n      <ds-flex-item width=\"3\"><ds-placeholder>3</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n    </ds-flex>\n  ```\n\n  You can set widths as fix values.\n  ```\n    <ds-flex>\n      <ds-flex-item width=\"200px\"><ds-placeholder>200px</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n      <ds-flex-item><ds-placeholder>1</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n      <ds-flex-item width=\"30%\"><ds-placeholder>30%</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n    </ds-flex>\n  ```\n\n  You can set a default width for each item on the flex component.\n  ```\n    <ds-flex width=\"50%\">\n      <ds-flex-item><ds-placeholder>item</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n      <ds-flex-item><ds-placeholder>item</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n      <ds-flex-item width=\"100%\"><ds-placeholder>item</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n      <ds-flex-item><ds-placeholder>item</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n      <ds-flex-item><ds-placeholder>item</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n    </ds-flex>\n  ```\n\n  ## Column Gutter\n\n  You can set a gutter for each item on the flex component.\n  ```\n    <ds-flex gutter=\"small\">\n      <ds-flex-item><ds-placeholder>same</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n      <ds-flex-item><ds-placeholder>same</ds-placeholder></ds-flex-item>\n    </ds-flex>\n    <ds-flex

Responsive Breakpoints\n\n  Sometimes we need to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.\n  Therefore width, gutter and direction can be set as an object of breakpoints `base, xs, sm, md, lg,

data() {\n      return {\n        tableFields: {\n          name: 'Hero',\n          type: {\n            label: 'Job',\n            width: '300px'\n          }\n        },\n        tableData: [\n          {\n            name: 'Rengar',\n            type: 'Jungler',\n            loves: 'Hide and seek'\n          },\n          {\n            name: 'Renekton',\n            type: 'Toplaner',\n

columns and create columns that do not have a corresponding data attribute.\n\nVia scoped slots you have access to the columns `row`, `index` and `col`.\n```\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <ds-table

Usage with label\n\n  ```\n  <ds-input\n    id=\"name\"\n    label=\"Your name\"\n    placeholder=\"Name ...\"/>\n  ```\n\n  ## Input types\n\n  You can use an input for different types of input.\n\n  ```\n  <template>\n    <div>\n      <ds-input v-model=\"text\"></ds-input>\n      <ds-input v-model=\"text\" type=\"password\"></ds-input>\n      <ds-input v-model=\"text\" type=\"textarea\" rows=\"2\"></ds-input>\n    </div>\n  </template>\n  <script>\n    export default {\n      data() {\n        return {\n          text: 'Default text'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  ## Bind to a value\n\n  Use v-model to bind a value to the input.\n\n  ```\n  <template>\n    <div>\n      <ds-input\n        v-model=\"name\"\n        placeholder=\"Name ...\"></ds-input>\n      <ds-text>Your name: {{ name }}</ds-text>\n    </div>\n  </template>\n  <script>\n    export default {\n      data() {\n        return {\n          name: ''\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  ## Validation\n\n  We use <a href=\"https://github.com/yiminghe/async-validator\" targe=\"_blank\">async-validator schemas</a> for validation.\n\n  If you need to validate more than one field it is better to use the form component.\n\n  ```\n  <template>\n    <div>\n      <ds-input\n        v-model=\"name\"\n        :schema=\"{type: 'string', min: 6, message: 'Name must be longer' }\"\n        placeholder=\"Name ...\" />\n    </div>\n  </template>\n  <script>\n    export default {\n      data() {\n        return {\n          name: ''\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  ## Input sizes\n\n  ```\n  <ds-input placeholder=\"Small ...\" size=\"small\"></ds-input>\n  <ds-input placeholder=\"Base ...\"></ds-input>\n  <ds-input placeholder=\"Large ...\" size=\"large\"></ds-input>\n  ```\n\n  ## Input icons\n\n  Add an icon to help the user identify the input type.\n\n  ```\n  <ds-input placeholder=\"Search ...\" icon=\"search\"></ds-input>\n  <ds-input placeholder=\"Time ...\" icon=\"clock\"></ds-input>\n  <ds-input placeholder=\"Search ...\" icon-right=\"search\"></ds-input>\n  <ds-input placeholder=\"Search ...\" icon=\"search\" size=\"small\"></ds-input>\n  <ds-input placeholder=\"Search ...\" icon=\"search\" size=\"large\"></ds-input>\n  ```\n</docs>\n","import mod from
